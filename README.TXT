# Naughty Clock

A count-down or count-up timer clock desktop application.

# Rationale

When I was a school teacher this was useful for timing how long the children misbehaved and then punishing them
by detaining them for an equal amount of time.

# Warning

I was a junior dev when I wrote this.  It was written for JDK 1.5 and Netbeans forms.  I have updated it to work
with JDK 13 but otherwise left the mess as-is.
